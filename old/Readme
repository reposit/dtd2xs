DTD to XML Schema translator
----------------------------

For compatibility reasons we provide this version of dtd2xs for usage with
Java version <1.4.

If you are using Java version >1.4 you should use the file located in 
the upper directory.

This dtd2xs version uses the XML classes of James Clark.
